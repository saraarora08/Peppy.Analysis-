# Peppy.Analysis-
A SQL based business analysis project designed to uncover datacdriven insights for Peppy, a personal wellness brand.
Using structured datasets on customers, orders, and products, this project explores:

 * Revenue performance and top-selling categories

 * Customer behavior and repeat purchase trends

 * Sales channel performance and monthly growth

 * Product and marketing insights to guide brand strategy

This project demonstrates my ability to translate raw SQL data into strategic business insights, combining analytical and commercial thinking key skills for roles in Business Analytics and Strategy.
